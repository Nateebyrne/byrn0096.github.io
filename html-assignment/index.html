                    My name is Nathan Byrne. I am 21 years old and have lived in Ottawa my whole life. When I graduated high school I decided to go into political science at <abbr title="CU">Carleton University</abbr>. I chose this becasue my high school heavily pushed students in univeristy level classes to only apple for university programs. After my 2<sup>nd</sup> semester I realized I did not enjoy what I was studying and decided to work full time while I figured out what I wanted to do. After 2 years of working I decided to apply for the program I really wanted to go into in high school, <abbr title="IMD">Interactive Media Design</abbr> at Algonquin College.

                    I am someone who tries to enjoy life to the fullest. I believe we only have so much time on <em>Earth</em> and to waste it with worrying, stressing or being angry is a waste. We should be living in the moment and make every decision based on how you want to look back on your life after passing. I think one of the purposes of our lives is to do the most with it and die happy with how our lives were lived. I try to do this by enjoying nature, doing things I enjoy like biking and kayaking and just making everyday memorable. I also think its important to leave a good impression everywhere you can, the only thing that continues to lvie after we past is the memories of ourselves and I always try to make sure I leave a positve influence behind myself so that I may be fortunte enough to live on for years in peoples memories.
